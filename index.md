# CommentBeauty - reenable awesome dealing with each other on the Internet

Grow language flowers and become a comment pro! Respectful exchange for a friendly, healthy and harmonious coexistence in the "social" media.

## Orientation points

* Internalize a benevolent attitude
* Prefer first-person messages
* Remember the common goal in life: "Peace, joy, cake"
* Avoid pigeonholing
* Do not give unnecessary attention to /pol issues
* Discard "Friend or foe?" categorization
* Quality instead of quantity
* Do not overemphasize arguments of last resort
* Don't take yourself too seriously
* Dare, it's the Internet, you can edit it!

## Digital playground

In principle, it is possible to make public contributions on all low-barrier platforms. Open systems that can be indexed by search engines, such as forums, are preferable. They increase the visibility of your own contributions and help others to find them. A win-win situation for everyone involved.

By registering under a pseudonym, the desired anonymity is maintained for the time being. However, it does not protect you in the case of posts that are relevant under criminal law. Your IP address is stored by your internet provider. So think before you post something on the Internet.
